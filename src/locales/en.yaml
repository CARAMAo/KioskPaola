    The Museum of Saint Francis of Paola, located in the heart of the historic center, offers visitors an evocative journey that intertwines history, spirituality, and technological innovation. Ten themed rooms and a final gallery guide you on an emotional journey to discover the Saint’s life, cult, and universal legacy.

    The experience begins in the Welcome Hall, where a model of the city and an interactive monitor introduce the main historical and cultural testimonies of the area. From here you enter the room “The Sanctuary as it was and as it is”: here, a multitouch table recounts, through images and films, the evolution of the Sanctuary of Paola over the centuries.

    The room dedicated to the spread of the cult around the world broadens the view beyond local borders: two interactive tables and a large planisphere show how devotion to Saint Francis has reached numerous countries, becoming a heritage shared by different cultures.

    The route continues in the “Minims and Relics” room, where the history of the Order founded by the Saint is explored. A striking holographic pyramid offers visitors a 3D reconstruction of the relics kept in the Sanctuary.

    Two subsequent rooms recount the strong bond with local communities: the Patronage of Sicily and the Patronage of Calabria rooms, enriched with panels and video projections, bear witness to the deep devotion that binds the Saint to the people of the two regions.

    The Patronage of seafarers, instead, takes shape in a virtual reality experience: by wearing a headset, visitors can relive the famous miracle of the cloak, a symbol of protection for those who face the sea.

    The room dedicated to Beatification and Canonization features a projection on a lectern showing the papal bull by which Francis was proclaimed a Saint, restoring the solemnity of that historical moment.

    The route culminates in the final Gallery, where an emotional set-up made of panels and multimedia content accompanies visitors in an intimate reflection on the double face of Francis: man and saint. 

    Completing the experience are the conference room, equipped with a reading corner and an interactive table for browsing digital volumes, and the bookshop, which allows visitors to take home a memory of the visit and further deepen their knowledge of the Saint.

    The Sanctuary of Saint Francis of Paola has a long history, with roots that reach back to the fifteenth century, around the years 1435–1452. When the first followers began to gather, Francis conceived the idea of building a small church—typical of every hermitage—as a place of prayer for hermits and for the faithful who came there. The “primitive oratory” is now part of the convent’s underground areas and can be reached by a small staircase near the cloister. It was built around 1436 on the left bank of the Isca river, approximately 60 meters from his grotto.
    After the first years of strict eremitic life in the ancient hermitage, the number of followers began to grow and the “primitive oratory” proved insufficient. Thus, around 1452, Francis set about building the Church. According to contemporary accounts, the initial idea seems to have been to build a small, cramped structure. However, following the apparition of a Friar (Saint Francis of Assisi, according to the most widespread interpretation), who suggested enlarging the perimeter of the Church because it would be destined to welcome an ever-increasing number of faithful, Francis changed the project, expanded the perimeter, and completed it in a short time thanks to Providence and the generosity of some gentlemen from Cosenza.

    The life of Saint Francis began on March 27, 1416. Giacomo Martolilla and Vienna of Fuscaldo, parents of the Calabrian hermit, lived in Paola, a village of about a thousand inhabitants overlooking the Tyrrhenian coast, and devoted themselves to field work and housework. According to tradition, the event of his birth was accompanied by extraordinary signs: the local people saw tongues of fire—“la vampa”—over the house where Vienna was giving birth to Francis. 
    At about the age of fifteen, Francis was accompanied by his parents to the Franciscan convent of San Marco Argentano to fulfill a vow. He stayed for a year with the friars as an oblate. Later, Francis expressed to his parents the desire to make a pilgrimage to Assisi to ask once again his patron Saint to help him understand his vocation. Returning to Paola, the young man openly declared his resolute decision: he wanted to leave his family to serve the Lord as a hermit. He did not even return home, but stopped directly on a plot of land owned by his family to establish there his new dwelling. It was probably 1435; Francis was about nineteen years old and, with determination, he withdrew to the area where the Sanctuary now stands, having as his only shelter a small cave, set in a wooded area.
    The hermitage soon expanded to welcome the sick of every kind, who flocked to the good friar to receive a prayer of intercession and a remedy that might resolve their health problems. Lepers, the blind, the mute, the lame, the paralyzed, women in labor, and people with every sort of difficulty went with trust to Francis, who for many was already to be considered a saint, because through his intercession they found themselves healed. In addition to the numerous healings obtained through the intercession of Saint Francis, the chronicles of the time also bear witness to the power that God had given this man over the forces of nature, which, in his presence, bowed docilely. By the strength of the good Friar’s prayer, the sea stilled its fury, stones halted their course, fire obeyed and refrained from exercising its force.
    The fame of Francis’s holiness spread rapidly throughout the Kingdom of Naples and beyond. It happened that a Neapolitan merchant, Matteo Coppola, while in France on business, spoke of the miracles worked by the friar from Paola, and word reached the ears of King Louis XI, who for some time had isolated himself in the castle of Plessis-lès-Tours because he was gravely ill. The King of France, having received an initial refusal from Francis, turned to the Pope, who delivered to Francis of Paola a mandate of obedience, to which the poor hermit could not offer any resistance; thus, though against his own wishes, he abandoned himself to God’s will and departed. For Francis, obedience to the Church was much more than a simple duty. In fact, for the Saint, the Pope’s request had the value of a seal, that is, the undoubted will of God, to which the friar had always humbly submitted.
    He was about sixty-seven years old when the bonhomme—as the French began to call him—arrived in Tours together with some confreres. Louis XI did not obtain the physical healing he so greatly hoped for—“it was not God’s will,” Francis explained to him—but he obtained conversion. He died shortly thereafter with the comfort of the now elderly friar, to whom the king entrusted the spiritual guidance of his son (Charles VIII), still young. For this reason, Francis did not return to Calabria, but lived in France for another twenty-four years, always taking care of the monarchs and expanding his religious family. After a very brief illness, on April 2, 1507, Good Friday, Francis died surrounded by the love of his confreres, leaving them as an inheritance a Rule—considered a light for penitents—and an example of a life lived in holiness.

    Coastal center located on the slope of the western foothills, stretching from the current castle rock down to the sea.
    The city is dominated by the Castle, whose presence is attested by the remains of the fortified city, and by the Sanctuary–Basilica of Saint Francis, located outside the town near the Isca stream, and built in several phases starting from 1469. The “Castrum” of Norman age is represented by the castle and the cylindrical tower (today the only surviving element among the ruins of the manor). Inside, the tower features a peculiarity: at the first floor the plan is octagonal, with a ribbed vault, considered of Swabian cultural imprint, from the time of Frederick II.
    The center of Paola features a ridge route (SS18 Salerno–Reggio Calabria) and a counter-ridge (Via Nazionale) and is structured in districts called: Motta; Baracche; Pietre Bianche; Rupa; Cancello; Spagnuolo. Viewpoint: Piazza Sette Fontane. Cathedral, dedicated to the Annunciation and located in the historic center.

    In 1982, in the Cutura area, north of Paola, Roman remains from the imperial age were found, attesting to the area’s frequentation in ancient times.
    During the Byzantine domination, the territory of Paola became a Byzantine possession, which led to the spread of worship in these areas.
    Around the year 1000, aboard their powerful drakkars, the Normans—warriors from Scandinavia—arrived in Italy. They were led by William of Hauteville, called “Iron Arm,” and by his brother Drogo. In a short time these leaders took from the Byzantines control of southern Italy, starting from Sicily. In 1050 Robert of Hauteville, called the Guiscard, arrived in Calabria, joined in 1057 by his brother Roger. The two began besieging the main cities of Calabria, initially encountering opposition from the papacy. In the Battle of Civitate, the volunteer army led by Leo IX suffered a total defeat and the pope himself was captured by the Normans. With the arrival of the Scandinavians all Orthodox dioceses were converted into Catholic dioceses, so Pope Nicholas II decided to forge an alliance with the new rulers of the south, and in 1059 at Melfi he solemnly invested Robert Guiscard with the title of “Duke of Apulia, Calabria and Sicily.”
    The city of Paola owes to the Normans the construction of the “Castle of Paola” around the year 1110. This stronghold was erected using mortar and tuff, in a strategic position overlooking the city, with the aim of protecting monks and inhabitants from soldiers passing through the Paola area. Castle and city walls (1100 AD). The entrance is to the north (Porta Cancello); during the War of the Vespers, 1282–88, it sheltered the fleeing population. Residence of the feudal lords, enriched and sumptuously furnished under the Spinelli family. Stormed, looted, and ruined by the Turks in 1555; until 1806 it was the residence of the marquises Spinelli of Fuscaldo. In 1806, attacked by the Bourbons, it became a prison and began the definitive decline that today leaves it a ruin.

    Paola benefited from the reign of Frederick II of Swabia and progressively began to grow in size and importance, until, when Calabria passed from Swabian to Angevin rule, the latter favored the concentration of the population—affected by the long conflict—in safer, more defensible areas (creating today’s historic center), which at the time were transformed into a fief and entrusted to the Ruffo family of Montalto, later Princes of Rossano. From the Fuscaldo hamlets of San Michele (around the Monastery of Saint Michael the Archangel) and Fosse (Monastery around Santa Maria delle Fosse, today the suburbs of Paola), the inhabitants moved to the hamlet of Paola, which was safer.
    In 1496, Ferrante II of Aragon confiscated the fief from the Count of Montalto to alienate it “in perpetuum” to Giovan Battista Spinelli, Count of Cariati and Duke of Castrovillari, “consiliario et oratori suo dilectissimo.” The intervention of the Spinelli resulted in better organization of the territory, which positively affected agriculture. In 1567 the fief was sold to the marquises Spinelli of Fuscaldo, who held it until the abolition of feudalism (1806)

    The Association “Il Cammino di San Francesco di Paola” was founded to enhance the namesake hiking route, inaugurated in 2017. The Association was established to formalize the project and to implement and promote it. The Route was designed to unite naturalistic interests with historical, cultural, and religious ones. The figure of Saint Francis of Paola, known throughout the world, exerts a strong appeal, especially in certain places that are testimonies of traditions, devotional practices, and cultural activities that deserve to be enhanced also through forms of experiential tourism.

    Currently, the Association takes care of promotion, dissemination, organization of the hospitality network, distribution of credentials, and maintenance of the Route’s signage. It also coordinates the network of other associations, institutions, public and private entities that have shown an interest in the Route.

    The Route of Saint Francis of Paola is a slow-travel itinerary that retraces the journeys undertaken by the friar from Paola in different places, for different reasons, and in different periods of his life. Once completed, the Route will represent a “biography on the map”, composed of six Ways.
    At present, three journeys can be walked in complete autonomy, for a total of 318.3 km divided into 15 adjustable stages: the Way of the Youth (San Marco Argentano – Paola); the Way of the Hermit (Paola – Paterno, and back); the Way of the Monasteries (Paterno – Corigliano, and back); the Way to France (Corigliano – Monte Sant’Angelo, and back).
    Once credentials have been purchased, one can choose whether to walk one or two Ways, or the entire Route.

    At about the age of 14, in 1430, Francis spent a votive year at a Franciscan convent to fulfill a vow made by his parents. The Way of the Youth represents the journey of restlessness: in fact, Francis decided not to remain in that convent and to return home, to Paola, while having understood that he wanted to dedicate his entire life to God, yet without knowing how.

    After living for several years as a perfect hermit, Francis opened himself to cenobitic life to follow God’s will. After the construction of the convent in Paola came that of Paterno in 1472. Brother Francis, now mature, thus began to spread in Calabria the Order of the Minims; he walked this way several times to go back and forth between the two communities and, for this reason, the route can be walked from Paola to Paterno or vice versa.

    The itinerary links all the convents founded by Francis in Calabria during his lifetime, after that of Paola (1435–1450). The Friar personally dedicated himself to founding the churches in Paterno (1472), Spezzano della Sila (1474), and Corigliano Calabro (1476).
